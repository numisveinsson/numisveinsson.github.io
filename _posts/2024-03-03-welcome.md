### Who am I?

I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley studying Mechanical Engineering. I am passionate about using computational tools to solve problems in the medical field and elsewhere. I am currently particularly interested in the intersection of engineering and deep learning and healthcare.

### What is this blog about?

This blog is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and experiences. I hope to share my journey as a graduate student and the projects I work on.

I wish to also share some technical tutorials and guides that I find useful. I hope to share some of the things I learn along the way.

### What can you expect to find here?

#### Coding Tutorials

I mainly work with Python (and sometime Matlab) so most of the tutorials will be related to these languages. I will also share some of the tools and libraries I use.

#### Specific Technical Posts

I will share technical posts about the projects I work on; which packages I use, and how I use them. Specifically, you will find posts about the following fields:

- Geometric Modeling

- Computational Simulation (FEM, CFD)

- Medical Imaging Processing

- Machine Learning (Deep Learning)

#### General Thoughts About Graduate School, Education, and Engineering

I hope to share some of my thoughts on the graduate school experience, including tips and tricks I learn along the way. I also hope to share some of my thoughts on the engineering field and the education system. I would love to hear your thoughts on these topics as well.
