## Introduction

In many of my recent projects on **patient-specific vascular modeling** — from segmentation to simulation — I’ve run into the same problem over and over: managing the data.  
Not just storing it, but doing so in a way that’s traceable, reproducible, and easy for others (and algorithms) to use.

That challenge became the motivation for creating a **vascular model repository** [(see VMR here)](https://vascularmodel.com)— a structured system for organizing, versioning, and sharing vascular data with clear metadata and consistent workflows. What follows is an overview of the design decisions and practical trade-offs involved in building it.

***

## Traceability and Persistent Identifiers

One of the most important principles is **traceability**.  
Once data enters the repository, its full history should stay visible — including updates or replacements over time.

Each dataset gets a **persistent identifier (DOI)**, ensuring that anyone citing or using it can always trace back to the exact version referenced.  
When updates are made, the old versions remain archived and linked through a clear version history.  
That version lineage is what gives the data real scientific credibility.

## Naming Structure and Standardization

Naming conventions sound trivial until you try to merge data from multiple sources — hospitals, labs, and research groups, each with their own systems.  

The repository uses a **standardized naming pattern** to keep things consistent:  
`{StudyName}{PatientID}{Region}{Modality}{Version}`  
Example: `CCTA001_LAD_CT_v2`

But older datasets don’t always fit. For those, we wrote **mapping scripts** that automatically translate legacy names into the new format.  
It’s a constant balance — enforcing standards without breaking compatibility with existing archives.

***

## Hosting and Backup

Reliability starts with where the data lives.  
The repository runs on a **dedicated research server** with **backups**, so no single point of failure can wipe anything out.  

We should also experiment with **cloud-based object storage** (S3-compatible) for long-term archiving, which would make scaling and collaboration much easier while keeping version control intact.

## Workflow for Adding New Data

Adding data should be simple, not chaotic.  
The submission process follows three main steps:

1. **Upload** — contributors upload their model files (segmentations, meshes, or simulation results).  
2. **Metadata Form** — they fill in key details: study name, region, modality, preprocessing steps, and license.  
3. **Validation Check** — automated scripts confirm that the files and metadata follow the required format and naming rules.

This keeps the workflow lightweight, but structured enough to guarantee completeness and consistency.

## Quality Control

Every dataset should go through **quality control (QC)** before it’s officially added.  
That includes:

- Checking geometry for intersections or topological errors  
- Visual review of segmentations  
- Verifying metadata consistency  
- Optional short simulation runs to test validity  

Contributors should also be able to run the same QC scripts locally before submitting, which helps maintain a uniform quality standard across contributions.

***

## Automated and AI-Based Validation

Manual review doesn’t scale forever.  
That’s where **AI-assisted validation** comes in — lightweight automated checks that flag potential issues, such as:

- Incomplete or disconnected vessel trees  
- Unusual geometries  
- Low-confidence segmentation areas  

These don’t replace human review but act as an early filter, keeping the process fast while maintaining trust in the data.

***

## Data Structure and ML Compatibility

A big design goal was making data not just organized, but **usable**.  
Consistent folder hierarchies, standardized formats (`.nii.gz`, `.vtp`, `.stl`), and structured JSON metadata mean that ML or coding workflows can plug in directly.  

With this structure, training pipelines can automatically parse metadata, load the correct models, and run experiments — a major step toward reproducible research at scale.

***

## Looking Ahead

This repository isn’t just a storage project; it’s an attempt to make vascular data **reliable, transparent, and usable**.  
Having structured, traceable datasets doesn’t just help with reproducibility — it builds trust and speeds up collaboration across groups.

Next steps include:
- Finalizing the metadata schema and submission interface  
- Releasing the first curated models with DOIs
