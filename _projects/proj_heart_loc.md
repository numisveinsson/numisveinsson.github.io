## Motivation and Goals

The accurate modeling of the heart and its interconnected blood vessels from 3D medical image volumes, such as CT or MRI scans, holds immense potential for enhancing clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical education. By creating detailed 3D geometric models, clinicians can better visualize cardiac anatomy, identify abnormalities, and tailor interventions with higher precision. However, the process of accurately locating the heart within volumetric data and subsequently segmenting its chambers remains a significant challenge. Our research aims to address this challenge by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to automatically locate and segment the heart, paving the way for comprehensive 3D modeling.

## Background

In medical imaging, accurately identifying the heart within volumetric data is crucial for subsequent analyses and modeling. Traditional methods for heart localization and segmentation often rely on manual interventions or simplistic algorithms, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advent of deep learning, there has been a paradigm shift towards automated approaches that can handle the complexity and variability of medical images more effectively. Our research builds upon this foundation by exploring novel deep learning architectures and methodologies to precisely locate the heart in 3D medical image volumes. By incorporating robust augmentation techniques and diverse training data, we aim to develop a reliable and adaptable system capable of handling variations in image quality, orientation, and anatomical differences among patients.

## Methods

### Heart Localization Using Deep Learning
To locate the heart within 3D medical image volumes, we employ deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on annotated datasets. We investigate two primary approaches:
1. **Pixel-wise Segmentation**: In this approach, we employ binary classification to label pixels belonging to the heart. Subsequently, post-processing techniques are applied to calculate the center of mass and estimate the size of the heart. This method provides a detailed segmentation of cardiac structures but may be computationally intensive.
2. **Gaussian Distribution Regression**: Alternatively, we directly estimate the center of the heart using regression techniques. Instead of pixel classification, we regress the spatial coordinates of the heart's center based on Gaussian distributions. The ground truth annotations include the z-value of each pixel relative to the center of the heart, typically chosen as the aortic valve. This approach offers a more direct and computationally efficient method for heart localization, particularly suitable for real-time applications.

By comparing and evaluating these methodologies, we aim to develop a robust and accurate system for automatic heart localization within 3D medical image volumes, laying the groundwork for comprehensive geometric modeling of the heart and its connected blood vessels.
