I am excited to announce that I have been selected to participate in the 2024 SDSC Summer Institute. This workshop will provide me with the opportunity to learn about the latest tools and technologies in HPC and data science, and to network with researchers and professionals in these fields. I am grateful to the SDSC for this opportunity and support. :computer: :star:

I was additionally awarded a scholarship to attend the SDSC Summer Institute this year. :tada:
    
The SDSC Summer Institute is a week-long workshop hosted by the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego focusing on a broad spectrum of introductory-to-intermediate topics in High Performance Computing and Data Science. The program is aimed at researchers in academia and industry, especially in domains not traditionally engaged in supercomputing or data science. The institute will include a mix of lectures and hands-on sessions on a range of topics, including:
- HPC and Data Science Fundamentals
- Parallel Programming and Optimization
- Machine Learning and Data Analytics
- Visualization and Data Management
- Scientific Workflows and Containers
- Cloud Computing and Data Privacy
