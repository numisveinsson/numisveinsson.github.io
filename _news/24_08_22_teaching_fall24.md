I am excited to announce that I will be a teaching assistant for a graduate course on **Finite Element Method** in the Fall of 2024. The course will cover the fundamentals of the finite element method, including the theory, implementation, and applications in engineering and science. Topics will include:
* Introduction to the finite element method
* Variational formulation and weak form
* Finite element discretization
* Finite element analysis of heat transfer problems
* Finite element analysis of fluid flow problems
* Finite element analysis of nonlinear problems
* Finite element analysis of time dependent problems
