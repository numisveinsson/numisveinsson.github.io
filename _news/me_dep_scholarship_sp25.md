:star: I am excited to announce that I have been awarded a 2025 Spring M.E. Department Scholarship by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. This scholarship will support my research on the development of computational tools for the analysis of blood flow and medical images. I am grateful to the department for this recognition and support. :star:
