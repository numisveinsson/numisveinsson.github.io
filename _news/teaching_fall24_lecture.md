I got the opportunity to deliver a lecture on the topic of **Linear Solvers**. I covered the following topics in the lecture:
* Direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems
* Sparse matrix storage and manipulation
* Applications of linear solvers in finite element analysis

This lecture was my first experience in delivering a lecture in a graduate course, and I enjoyed the experience of preparing and presenting the material to the students. I have a feeling that I will be teaching more courses in the future, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing to the education and training of future engineers and scientists.
