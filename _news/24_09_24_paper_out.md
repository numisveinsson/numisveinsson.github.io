My first paper just got published in the Annals of Biomedical Engineering! :tada: :star:

The paper presents a novel method for automatic vascular model construction using deep learning. The method, called SeqSeg, learns local segments of the vascular tree and assembles them into a complete model. The method was evaluated on a dataset of CT and MRI aortic/aortofemoral models and achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
