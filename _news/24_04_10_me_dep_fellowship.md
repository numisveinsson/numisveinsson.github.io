:star: I am excited to announce that I have been awarded a 2024 Summer M.E. Department Fellowship by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. This fellowship will support my research on the development of computational tools for the analysis of blood flow and medical images. I am grateful to the department for this recognition and support. :mortar_board: :computer: :microscope: :heart:
