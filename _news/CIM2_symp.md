Just rsvp'd to the 2024 Cardiovascular Imaging, Mechanics, and Modeling Symposium (CIM2) at Stanford University. I am looking forward to learning about the latest research and development efforts in cardiovascular imaging, image analysis, heart modelling, and much more. I am grateful to the Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Group for organizing this event and for the opportunity to participate. :star:
