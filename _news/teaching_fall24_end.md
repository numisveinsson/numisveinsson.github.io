I have completed my teaching assistantship for the graduate course on **Finite Element Method** in the Fall of 2024. I enjoyed working with the students and faculty in the course, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the teaching and learning experience. I look forward to future opportunities to teach and mentor students in the field of computational mechanics and engineering.

I am proud to share the results from the teaching evaluations for the course:

* **The GSIâ€™s instructional activities, contributions, and/or feedback enhanced my learning**: 6.71/7 (dept. average: 6.03)

* **The GSI created an environment in which I could feel included**: 6.81/7 (dept. average: 6.07)

* **Please rate the GSI's overall teaching effectiveness**: 6.50/7 (dept. average: 5.91)

Some of the comments from the students in the course include:

* "Numi was the best GSI I have ever had. I would not have made it through the course without his help."

* "Very helpful teaching climate and always available."

* "Numi has a great energy and is encouraging."

* "Numi was awesome. Was great at going over important things that might have been difficult to understand and implement just from lecture alone, and was very accessible and helpful both in office hours and outside of office hours through Ed Discussion or email."

* "I wouldn't have been able to survive this course without Numi. An amazing GSI who made learning the material fun and interesting. Was always patient with every student in answering their questions. Very responsive to the needs of the class and effective at responding to questions. Discussion and office hours were well worth their weight in gold. Numi is an exemplary GSI."

* "Numi make the office hour environment very inclusive and thus make it easy for student to approach and best utilize the office hour by asking questions."
