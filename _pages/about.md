I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Computational Medicine at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at UT Austin, working with Prof. Charley Taylor on computational and AI-driven methods for cardiovascular and respiratory modeling and digital twin development.

I completed my Ph.D. with Prof. Shawn Shadden at UC Berkeley, where my research combined biomechanics, machine learning, and computational modeling to better understand cardiovascular health. My current work extends these ideas to the intersection of cardiovascular and respiratory modeling, artificial intelligence, and simulation, in collaboration with the <a href="https://cbcl.stanford.edu">Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a> at Stanford University and the <a href="https://shaddenlab.berkeley.edu">Shadden Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. I also contribute to <a href="https://simvascular.github.io">SimVascular</a>, an open-source platform for patient-specific blood flow simulation, and the <a href="https://www.vascularmodel.com">Vascular Model Repository</a>, a public resource for sharing high-quality vascular data and models.

Iâ€™m passionate about collaborative, translational research and about using engineering and data-driven approaches to address real medical challenges.

Outside the lab, I enjoy exploring history, traveling, gardening, and cooking with friends.
