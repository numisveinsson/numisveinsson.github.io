Hey there! I'm a PhD candidate delving into the exciting world of biomechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. My research journey involves a passionate mix of biomechanics, machine learning, and computer modeling.

Currently, I'm at the crossroads of cardiovascular health, computational modeling, and deep neural networks. I'm teaming up with the <a href='https://cbcl.stanford.edu'>Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a> at Stanford University to craft <a href='https://simvascular.github.io'>SimVascular</a>, an open-source software for patient-specific blood flow modeling. We're also building a free, open-access <a href='https://www.vascularmodel.com'>Vascular Model Repository</a> because sharing is caring, especially in the realm of cutting-edge research.

I thrive on collaboration and adore applying engineering and machine learning to real-world problems. Let's connect and brainstorm some groundbreaking ideas!

Highly enjoy collaboration of all sorts, especially regarding application of engineering and machine learning on real world problems.

Hobbies include history, traveling, growing plants and cooking with friends.
Outside the lab, I find joy in exploring history, jet-setting to new destinations, nurturing green life, and whipping up culinary wonders with friends. Life's an adventure, and I'm here for it all!
