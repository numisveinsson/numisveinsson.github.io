Currently working in the intersection of cardiovascular health, computational modeling and deep neural networks. 

Partnering with <a href='https://cbcl.stanford.edu'>Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a>  at Stanford University to develop the open-source software <a href='https://simvascular.github.io'>SimVascular</a> for patient-specific blood flow modeling and free, open-access <a href='https://www.vascularmodel.com'>Vascular Model Repository</a>.

Highly enjoy collaboration of all sorts, especially regarding application of engineering and machine learning on real world problems.

Hobbies include history, traveling, growing plants and cooking with friends.
