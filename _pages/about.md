Currently at the Center for Computational Medicine at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at UT Austin, working with Prof. Charley Taylor on computational and AI-driven methods for cardiovascular and respiratory modeling and digital twin development.

I completed my Ph.D. with Prof. Shawn Shadden at UC Berkeley, where my research combined biomechanics, machine learning, and computational modeling to better understand cardiovascular health. My current work extends these ideas to the intersection of cardiovascular and respiratory modeling, artificial intelligence, and simulation, in collaboration with the <a href="https://cbcl.stanford.edu">Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a> at Stanford University and the <a href="https://shaddenlab.berkeley.edu">Shadden Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. I also contribute to <a href="https://simvascular.github.io">SimVascular</a>, an open-source platform for patient-specific blood flow simulation, and the <a href="https://www.vascularmodel.com">Vascular Model Repository</a>, a public resource for sharing high-quality vascular data and models.

I’m passionate about collaborative, translational research and about using engineering and data-driven approaches to address real medical challenges.

Currently working in the intersection of cardiovascular health, computational modeling and deep neural networks. 

Partnering with <a href='https://cbcl.stanford.edu'>Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a>  at Stanford University to develop the open-source software <a href='https://simvascular.github.io'>SimVascular</a> for patient-specific blood flow modeling and free, open-access <a href='https://www.vascularmodel.com'>Vascular Model Repository</a>.

Highly enjoy collaboration of all sorts, especially regarding application of engineering and machine learning on real world problems.

Hobbies include history, traveling, growing plants and cooking with friends.
Outside the lab, I find joy in exploring history, jet-setting to new destinations, nurturing green life, and whipping up culinary wonders with friends. Life's an adventure, and I'm here for it all!
