Hey there! I'm an energetic and optimistic PhD candidate delving into the exciting world of biomechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. My research journey involves a passionate mix of biomechanics, machine learning, and computer modeling.

Currently, I'm at the crossroads of cardiovascular health, computational modeling, and deep neural networks. I'm teaming up with the <a href='https://cbcl.stanford.edu'>Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a> at Stanford University to craft <a href='https://simvascular.github.io'>SimVascular</a>, an open-source software for patient-specific blood flow modeling. We're also building a free, open-access <a href='https://www.vascularmodel.com'>Vascular Model Repository</a> because sharing is caring, especially in the realm of cutting-edge research.

I thrive on collaboration and adore applying engineering and machine learning to real-world problems. Let's connect and brainstorm some groundbreaking ideas!

Outside the lab, I find joy in exploring history, jet-setting to new destinations, nurturing green life, and whipping up culinary wonders with friends. Life's an adventure, and I'm here for it all!
