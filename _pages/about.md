Enthusiastic and positive PhD candidate in biomechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. Research interests include biomechanics, machine learning and computer modeling. 

Currently working in the intersection of cardiovascular health, computational modeling and deep neural networks. 

Partnering with <a href='https://cbcl.stanford.edu'>Cardiovascular Biomechanics Computation Lab</a>  at Stanford University to develop the open-source software <a href='https://simvascular.github.io'>SimVascular</a> for patient-specific blood flow modeling and free, open-access <a href='https://www.vascularmodel.com'>Vascular Model Repository</a>.

Highly enjoy collaboration of all sorts, especially regarding application of engineering and machine learning on real world problems.

Hobbies include history, traveling, growing plants and cooking with friends.
