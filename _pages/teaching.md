I completed my teaching assistantship for this graduate course in the Fall of 2024. I enjoyed working with the students and faculty, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the teaching and learning experience in computational mechanics and engineering.

#### Teaching Evaluations

The course received strong student evaluations, with scores above the department average:

- **GSI's instructional activities enhanced my learning**: 6.71/7 (department average: 6.03)
- **GSI created an inclusive learning environment**: 6.81/7 (department average: 6.07)
- **Overall teaching effectiveness**: 6.50/7 (department average: 5.91)

#### Student Feedback

> "Numi was the best GSI I have ever had. I would not have made it through the course without his help."

> "Numi was awesome. Was great at going over important things that might have been difficult to understand and implement just from lecture alone, and was very accessible and helpful both in office hours and outside of office hours through Ed Discussion or email."

> "I wouldn't have been able to survive this course without Numi. An amazing GSI who made learning the material fun and interesting. Was always patient with every student in answering their questions. Very responsive to the needs of the class and effective at responding to questions. Discussion and office hours were well worth their weight in gold. Numi is an exemplary GSI."

> "Numi make the office hour environment very inclusive and thus make it easy for student to approach and best utilize the office hour by asking questions."

> "Very helpful teaching climate and always available."

> "Numi has a great energy and is encouraging."
